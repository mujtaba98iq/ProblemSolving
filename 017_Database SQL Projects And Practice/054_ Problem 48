SELECt    Top 1 Makes.Make,Count(*) As NumberOFModels
FROM            Makes INNER JOIN
                         MakeModels ON Makes.MakeID = MakeModels.MakeID
GROUP BY Makes.Make
Order By COUNT(*) Desc

--Prof solution
SELECT        Makes.Make, COUNT(*) AS NumberOfModels
		FROM            Makes INNER JOIN
								 MakeModels ON Makes.MakeID = MakeModels.MakeID
		GROUP BY Makes.Make

		having COUNT(*) = (

										select Max(NumberOfModels) as MaxNumberOfModels
										from
										(

												SELECT      MakeID, COUNT(*) AS NumberOfModels
												FROM
